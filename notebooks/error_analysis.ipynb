       "12141  nails These are beautiful nail stickers.  However, they are NOT precut so you have to cut them out yourself.  I did know that from reading reviews before I bought them but thought it would be a little bit easier.  Its not.  They are pretty and they stay on well but honestly just not worth the effort of cutting and then trying to \"pry\" the sticker from the back and then get it on your nail.  Also, found out the hard way that they dissolve very easily.  I washed my hands before applying the to...   \n",

WORTH every penny really folks this takes at least four months to see results, but after that my results came fast and quick ...not a con company just uses standard business butter up themes ...just give it more time I want to see this product work for other people..so that amazon has a positive scoring for this product ...REALLY WORKS OVER TIME!!, but maybe not for all   \n",
       "7529   Yes it's worth it!... :) The pump works by the bottom of the bottle rising to bring the product closer to the top of the inside of the pump. It adjusts to how much air needs to be in the bottle for it to be able to use suction to draw the liquid up, so it can then squirt out. So you don't need to add a lot once it adjusts. They work well and look very high end. The bottle isn't glass, more like just a hard plastic, but everything feels sturdy and like it will hold up. Everything fits and not...   \n",

       "6646   Not Bad! I've had it for over 3 months and I definitely feel a difference.  I use it to guard against dust mite allergies.  The allergies make me itch everywhere even though I see no bugs or bites.  It feels like millions of little bugs are crawling all over me.\\n\\nWhen I spray this on my clothes and bedding, after about 6 or 7 hours, I'm fine.  The relief lasts only for about a week or two.

I almost stopped looking for natural deodorants because non of the ones I had tried and paid top dollar for worked. One even made things worse in the smell department. So a friend told me of this brand. So I tried it for the last time (natural) deodorant. I'm sooo glad I did. It works, and I mean really works. No stink, no sweat.   \n",
