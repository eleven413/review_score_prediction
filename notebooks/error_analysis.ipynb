       "85161  Seriously good deodorant AND customer service This is seriously good deodorant. After trying countless other brands of natural deodorant and finding that either they flat out didn't work OR they worked for a few weeks or months before making me break out in an itchy rash, I tried Bali Secrets based on amazon reviews.

       "52267  Say good bye to puffy eyes I put these eye masks in the refrigerator before I put them on my eyes so that they would have a nice cooling effect and to help with the swelling/bags under my eyes.  They are a little slippery and a couple of times I ended up getting the liquid in my eyes so it takes a little bit of practice to get it right.  I wish the eye holes were just a little bit larger but overall I really liked this product.  My eye area appears to be refreshed after I've used them and I ...   \n",

My hair is short and very fine.  I guess if I just wanted to dry my hair it would be ok. But it certainly was not helpful in creating a look of fullness.  My regular blow dryer and handy brush do a better job.   \n",
